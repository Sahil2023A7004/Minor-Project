# Sniff is an inbuilt function that works with NIC to capture packets, 
# iface the interface we are using
# filter is we are capturing trffic on tcp port 443 and 80 only i.e HTTP & HTTPS No UDP 
# prn is an inbuilt module that repeatedly calls our function that is capture
# store is a function if we want to store the captured packets in a file 0 means FALSE

#Variables Used: packet to store incoming packet and return filtered packet.
#If you want to interact with this packet data you have to use variable name "packet" 
#Working prn inside calls the capture, sniff gets packet from NIC
#Supplies to capture where it is examined by hasLayer for IP and TCP
#If both IP and TCP exist Packet is passed to next file for JA4 fingerinting 
#OR if either IP or TCP or both are missing packet is dropped
